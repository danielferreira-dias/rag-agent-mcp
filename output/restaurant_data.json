While some travelers highlight long wait times due to the no-reservation policy, most agree the authentic and flavorful food, especially the seafood dishes like octopus and seafood rice, makes it worthwhile.\n\nThe friendly and attentive service also earns praise, contributing to the overall value, which travelers often find reasonable despite the wait for seating.",

        "review_text": "We had no idea that the restaurant we were about to have a long, boozy lunch in was a Michelin star level establishment disguised as a typical taberna. The restaurant is in the heart of the Ribera district/tourist area, so our expectations were set accordingly, and incorrectly. The atmosphere is very unique, with a beautifully lit ceiling that resembles the hull of an inverted boat. My husband and I split fried sardines and an octopus salad to start. The sardines were deliciously delicate and the octopus almost melted in your mouth. The octopus was immersed in a finely diced, pico de gallo-like sauce that was bright and refreshing. For the mains, my husband had the prawns and I had the fish of the day, a grilled sea bream. The server was a true artisan who filleted my fish impeccably. The fish was served with potatoes and saut√©ed vegetables that were seasoned to perfection. The fish was moist, delicate, and so wonderfully flavored with what I can only imagine was lemon, garlic, olive oil and salt. We were blown away. The prawns were the best we‚Äôd had in Portugal. It was our last day in Porto, but had we been here on our first day, we would have come back again and again. The lovely family that runs all aspects of the restaurant (chef and servers) are experts in their craft of hospitality and cooking. We are extremely grateful and lucky to have found this gem."

But the octopus rice was exceptional, please bring it back."

It opens at 7pm and people start queuing at 6pm.\n\nIt is worth the wait.\n\nFrom the friendly family, mother and son front of house and husband in the kitchen. They made everyone feel welcome and all the food was cooked fresh.\n\nWe were almost the last customers to leave the restaurant and were just chatting, they didn‚Äôt rush us and even recommended other restaurants to try in the local area."

You need to be in he queue at 6:45 or wait for the later sitting. It only takes 22 guests. We went back another evening at 6:15pm and the queue was already forming. The queue was organised and supervised by the staff. Opened at 7pm and what a delight. Family run by father (the chef) with mother, Regina, and son, Hugo serving. A great family atmosphere.\nWe had fried sardines and Bolinho de Bacalao as starters which were delicious. I had polvo (Octopus) a lagareiro. My wife had Bacalao (Cod) a lagareiro. Excellent Portuguese fare. All very fresh. \nFantastic and well worth the wait.  A special treat in this wonderful city. A great choice.  Good value."

The place is small but cozy, located in a parallel to the river bank. Since the place doesn't have many seats, the advice is to arrive at least an hour before the opening to get in line, or wait patiently for Hugo to make you sit down. The wait is ABSOLUTELY worth it. The dishes are sublimely cooked and are all delicious, but the real difference is the staff. Hugo and Regina bring their kindness into everything and make everything like being with the family! One of the best things to do in Porto, absolutely."

A family-run restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere, food and atmosphere.\nWe ate bacalao, best we have tasted and got a lovely surprise dessert at last.\nBe out in good time, no table reservation, but it's worth it in line to experience Taberna dos Fernandes. Thank you, greetings from Aud and Toril"

We came back two days later, and we stood in the line half an hour before the turn at 9:00. \n\nThe menu is similar or identical to that of all the local taverns.\n\nThe quality of the food was good but did not exceed that of other restaurants where we ate in Porto.\n\nPrices are about 10% higher than other restaurants of local character.\n\nOkay, but not as she shouted.\n - The exchange is not worth the long waiting line and probably not the definition of \"one of the best restaurants in Porto\"\n\nThere were no locals among them!\n\nIn conclusion, one of many without any culinary outline."

On our last night of family vacation in Portugal and Spain, we ended up browsing the streets of Porto, in hope to find a nice restaurant for dinner. Walking by Cantinho do Avillez we noticed a Michelin plaque, were very impressed with the quality of menu, but reasonable pricing for a Michelin restaurant, so we decided to eat here. Little did we know, that we needed reservations to get in! Fortunately, after we inquired within, manager on duty, Vitor, told us that we could have a table outside, on a sidewalk, which we wanted anyway. As soon as we sat down and ordered drinks it started raining, heavier and heavier. We asked if there‚Äôs any chance we could eat inside, but there was no room! However we hung around at the entrance to finish our drinks and kept talking to Vitor, hoping for an opening. Vitor performed some miracle and was able to seat us at one of the inside tables, but we had only 45 min to eat, because the table was reserved for later. We happily jumped on an opportunity, and what a feast we had! Quality of the food was absolutely out of this world. We had bread with spreads, deep fried beans, oven roasted cheese for an appetizer and then curry duck, Brazilian fish, scallops and stake dishes. Staff were very accommodating and helpful. Vitor stopped by to check on us. As we were exceeding our time to leave by little, Vitor assured us that we had time for desert, but we asked for the check earlier and waiter already gave it to us. Vitor insisted and arranged for a complimentary desert for the kids anyway, as we already paid the bill. Like I said, this was our final dinner of our 2 week trip, and believe you me! We ate some great stuff over our vacation, including at another Michelin restaurant. But Vitor truly made our night and vacation. This was a perfect ending to a perfect vacation. Muito obrigado, Vitor!"

We shared octopus tartare , and had sirloin steak and duck leg curry for mains, then creme brulee.\nThe bad bits... service was slow and dull. One waitress asked if we wanted a dessert.... when we hadn't even had the mains. The background music was like nite club music.... a bit of light jazz would be better. The lighting was quite dim... the family beside us used torches on their phone to see the menu and shined light into our \nfaces. The steak was served in a dark bowl which was difficult to cut steak in... we asked for a flat white plate. The creme brulee was not hard on top... we asked that be hardened a bit and it came back burnt on top. When the bill came it was almost ‚Ç¨10 more than expected (‚Ç¨137).....they had added a suggested tip which I declined to give preferring to leave a chosen cash tip, however after a final visit to the toilet which had no toilet paper we decided there was too much wrong to leave a tip at all.

We chose to be understandable up to a certain point BUT wait 10 minutes to see the Letter, while watching a very happy waitress dancing (and congratulations on the good mood but I mean... ) however in the end still receiving passive-aggressive responses at the moment that WITHOUT WARNING they \"charge\" another ‚Ç¨8 to the account as a bonus made everything more ridiculous... to the girl with short hair in the room, know that despite the language barrier, the Portuguese know how to identify when they are actually well treated and when they are not stupid You usually go back to places where you feel good and that's worth more than ‚Ç¨8.

When we asked about the ingredients of the dishes the staff did not know how to answer and the sympathy was not too much. We went through the experience and came disappointed.

The website is in four languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish and French), as befits an outpost of a chef apparently well known in Portugal.\nI had the prawns in olive oil and white wine with garlic, lemon and coriander, which was tasty but not particularly standout, followed by the confit of cod on Mafra bread and beautifully cooked savoy cabbage, with poached egg that transformed the cod once broken into, the egg yolk and cod being something sublime. My partner very much enjoyed her checking salad.\nMy dessert, a take on toucinho-do-ceu served with a delicious raspberry sorbet was unhelpfully served in a glass jar (for the couple beside us that turned what had been meant as a sharing experience into rather satisfactory shuttle service but staff failed to warn of that presentation), which made it more awkward to eat, a little undersized and not really adding anything aesthetically. My partner had sliced seasonal fresh fruit - if a restaurant is going to charge for this it really should be good quality but in her view was disappointing and outshone by that served at our hotel breakfast buffet. \nService was prompt and helpful and there was a good, lively atmosphere in the restaurant. \nOverall an enjoyable evening but let down by lack of attention on desserts."

Michelin might need to review their ratings and some biases. This restaurant has the ambience of a trattoria with mediocre food.

The specifically recommended the set lunch menu for ‚Ç¨18.50. The reason we booked the last lunch slot at 3pm was due to us returning to Lisbon that evening and wanted a late lunch. When we arrived we were handed the a la carte menu, we asked the waiter for the set lunch menu only to be told that you couldn‚Äôt order from that menu after 1:30pm. We reluctantly ordered off of the a la carte menu. When we went to pay there was a service charge added to the bill. We asked for that to be removed due to our displeasure. The waitress then said that you can order from the lunch menu up until 3pm (we arrived and sat down for our table at 2:55pm). After the meal I looked at the website and could not find the information about timings for the lunch menu anywhere. If you cannot order the lunch menu after 3pm then either the restaurant should not accept bookings at 3pm or the timings for the lunch menu should be advertised somewhere."

We made a reservation (it is essential!) and the house was full, unlike the other restaurants that were empty because it was not yet high season. But from the entrance to the restaurant door to the exit the service was IMPECABLE. With a lot of cordiality and sympathy, the waiters did not leave to wish in absolutely nothing. The food was delicious and surprised me by the complexity and specialty of the flavors. The portions are not large and I found, in my plate, little dust for a lot of potato pur√©. But that didn't affect the experience. The dish was very tasty and was the best pulp I ate in the whole trip through Portugal. The desserts were also great, I highly recommend the raspberries, it's an explosion of flavors in the mouth. My only reservation is about the space a little tight and with tables very close to each other, but that was not a problem. I highly recommend the meal in this place!"

I honestly am starting to prefer it more than Michelin star restaurants. \n\nRight in the beginning the entree was a statement, while the bread was not life changing, I found the olive Oil they offered to be of incredible quality, three varieties of butters that were incredibly tasty. \n\nWhen it was time to order, they instantly had me impressed by the fact that their relatively complex menu had not a single dish over 30‚Ç¨. \n\nWe were three people, we ordered the Cod, the Beef Wellington and the Pepper Steak. \nFor a starter we shared a beef carpaccio. \n\nThe beef carpaccio came in amazing, it was incredibly fresh with an amazing texture, great seasoning and oh god that special mayonnaise was amazing. \n\nWhen it was time for mains, all dishes arrived at the same time. All had an amazing visual. The cod was one of the best I‚Äôve eaten in Portugal, and I have tried a lot‚Ä¶ incredibly tender and delicious, accompanied by and amazing potato cheese egg trio that fit perfectly. \nThe beef wellington was a bit of an experimental recipe, so not to be compared with the traditional one. However it impressed, flaky and crunchy but yet so tender. And the pepper steak was a classic. \nIt was just as I expected it, perfectly cooked and seared, with that perfect taste. \n\nFor the star of the show, we shared three desserts, the crepe flamb√©ed, the fruit platter and the house classic chocolate cake. \n\nOh, my, word. The fruit was not anything special, but good. The crepes on the other hand were, creamy, flaky and delicious. \nWhat really nailed it however was the cake. That soft cake with a salty chocolate topping together with the homemade ice cream was one of the best things I‚Äôve had in my life. \n\nPortion sizes were perfec, and the service spectacular. And with wine, we paid 180‚Ç¨ for 3 persons. \n\nI can only recommend this restaurant."

We decline his offer and instead ask him for 2 glasses of white wine (15 cl as indicated on the menu).\nShe comes back 5 minutes later, uncorking a bottle of water in front of us. We tell him again that we don't want water. So, she grabs the bottle of white wine and serves us two glasses with very small portions.\nI tell my wife that it looks more like 5 cl portions instead of 15 cl as indicated on the menu. I don't say anything to the waitress so as not to start arguments and upset my wife. Subsequently, 3 people arrive at the next table. They order 1 glass of red wine and confirms what I thought. Their glass was more than twice as full as our glasses. Luckily for us we accepted the bread, butter and 6 olives for ‚Ç¨7. We decide not to have dessert to leave as quickly as possible. Indeed, we are very disappointed and we find all this unfair. As I told my wife, I check the bill being firmly convinced that the waitress will want to count the water for us. Alas, I was right to be wary. She actually counted the water in the bill. I tell the waitress that we haven't consumed any water and I ask her to do it again. She accepts.\nOn the other hand, on the receipt for the bill, they offer to leave a tip of 5% and then again, on the credit card machine, they offer to leave a tip of your choice of 5%, 10% or 15 %. Haha"

We had a reservation for 7:30 (19h30) and were told they needed the table back by 9:30 (21h30). Not a problem. The atmosphere is quite nice so we were excited. Unfortunately, the food was not great.\n\nWe ordered the fish soup, beef Wellington and the tiger prawns. Before we had taken a bite of food, except for the bread, two managers came by to ask if everything was ok.  At that point, it was.\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt when we took a few bites. Both the soup and the beef had undercooked puff pastry. The beef Wellington is described on the menu as \"Beef Fillet, Mushrooms Duxelle, Foie Gras in Puff Pastry with Roasted Vegetables\" That was not what we got. We got inconsistently cooked pieces of meat wrapped in undercooked puff pastry. The mushroom duxelles and foie gras were nowhere to be found. And while one small roasted onion cut in half and two tiny bok choy leaves technically constitutes a serving of roasted vegetables, it‚Äôs not really a serving. Two of the beef Wellingtons were bloody red in the middle and the other was well done.  The person who go the tiger prawns was very happy with their meal.\n\nAs they got busy, service slowed. After being told we had to vacate the table at 9:30-9:45, We weren‚Äôt able to flag down our waiter for the bill until after 10:00p (22h00) so I don‚Äôt understand why they told us we needed to leave. It just added anxiety to the evening. \n\nTo be fair, we didn‚Äôt complain and did not give them the opportunity for fix things."

        "review_text": "Had the scallops and carpaccio for starters. Scallops were delectable however i think it is reasonable to expect an even number. Carpaccio was a big portion, however it could have done with more pickle onion or greens and was lacking parmesan. The server suggested Douro white wine, which was fantastic and light. The service was quick and attentive. My mustard steak was one of the best iv ever had. Melts in your mouth, with a succulent gratin. The tiger prawn was alright. The chocolate cake, was more like a ganache. Again, for a restaurant of this caliber and formal setting I would opt for something easier to eat than stick to the teeth. Reservations r preferred in this joint. It is 6 mins from Praia da luz, which is nice to see the sunset and have a drink before dinner at Cafeina. Total bill for 2 incldg bottle of wine and tip was ‚Ç¨144."

The waiter explained that the chef wasn‚Äôt happy with the lobster soup which was fine as always pleased when the staff come out to explain any delays and it was absolutely delicious when it did eventually come out.

Special mention for the Carpaccio de Maronesa DOP, Portugal's best kept secret beats Wagyu hands-down. The staff are brilliant, Enrico and Joel deserve special mention. Both lunches were five stars and we may have find some willpower to keep our visits to only twice a month!"

Our server, Wesley was perfect in every recommendation from the wine to the starter to the main course.  He made us feel like he was welcoming us into his own home.  The Maitre D‚Äô was equally pleasant and accommodating.  We had 2 appetizers, salmon and scallops and they were outstanding.   My beef tenderloin with mustard sauce was so tender and delicious.  It is a 25 minute Uber drive from the city center but we‚Äôll worth the drive to this upscale Porto neighborhood.

Brasao Antas was super easy to book, even with limited Portuguese and the restaurant is well located, only a 10 minute walk from Combatentes metro station (on the D line towards Hospital Sao Joao).\n\nThe staff at the restaurant are super friendly, have great English (helpfully for tourists like us, the menu is in both English and Portuguese) and are really attentive, which made the whole meal a real pleasure. The food is definitely the star of the show, though - we had Rissol (like an empanada) and rice chips to start, with Portuguese steak and a goat's cheese salad for the mains and all of the dishes were super fresh, delicious and came with extremely generous portions!\n\nWell worth a visit if you're looking for a traditional, well priced Portuguese meal during your stay in Porto, especially if you happen to be staying in the more Northern part of the city or near to Estadio Dragao!"

The staff were incredibly responsive to my email request and assisted in booking a table for the suitable time - we were grateful for this as there was a queue outside the door when we arrived. The bread and nibbles were the perfect way to start before we enjoyed the Traditional Francestira dish (with side of fries) and Grilled Pork ribs in wine sauce. All dishes were piping hot, very flavoursome and delicious - all come recommended. The bill (including 5 large beers) came to ‚Ç¨25 which was great value considering the quality of food and proximity to the stadium. If you are visiting for an FC Porto game, this is a great place to start/end your visit!"

The decor is great and the whole place creates a really good first impression.\n\nOur waiter was superb throughout the night and advised us on the local dishes on the menu.  Bread, olives and fresh capers were supplied as a matter of course (the capers locally are incredible) and the drinks were brought quickly.\n\nWe skipped starters and went straight for mains, choosing the local speciality of Pica Pau.  This is a kind of stew with slow-cooked beef, sausages and pickled vegetables in a beefy, tomato sauce, with melted cheese and served with fries and bread.  I guess it‚Äôs a bit like the Franchescina sandwich, but with more emphasis on the meat.\n\nWhatever it is, it was absolutely delicious and we were so pleased we tried it.  It comes as a standard two person portion that you dig into and share, but you can order a half portion for one.\n\nFor dessert I had another Portuguese speciality called a Natas do Ceu, which is a crumble base with a very light milk mousse topped with a sable biscuit and mango sauce - do not pass go on this one - just order it!\n\nMy partner had the chocolate and hazelnut mousse which was served with all kinds of crumbly, soil-y type bits and was rich and smooth.\n\nWe had a bottle of house red and a beer to go with it and could have happily stayed there all night had we not been awake since 3am to get to Porto.\n\nAbsolutely superb experience - the food, service and ambience were fantastic and I‚Äôd throughly recommend a trip."

However, we couldn't be more satisfied with our choice, service and above all with the food, in which the Portuguese steak stood out, which was very tender, accompanied by a tasty sauce flavored with herbs, in my opinion the best ever. I ate! We couldn't help but mention the francesinhas which were also exceptional (note that it has a little hint of cuminhos for the weirdest) but also the quality pica-pau which is also based on the francesinha sauce. Regarding dessert, we ordered the delicious brownie, which is at least the equivalent of 2 desserts due to the portion size. But what we really liked most was Samuel's personalized service, which made the experience even more incredible. In short 10/10"

I can‚Äôt even imagine the workload upstream of the service.\nHe is also extremely attentive to his customers, always available to provide advice or explanations on the preparation of his dishes.\nMy partner had forgotten to order a side dish, he had a lot of orders but absolutely did not hesitate to make her salad right away so that she could eat her side dish at the same time as me.\nI wish all the success that this type of establishment deserves."

First, the setting: a magnificent zinc counter overlooking the kitchens, all within a small cosy restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. Then, the team: very friendly, attentive, and offering good advice! In short, a very enjoyable experience, and we were even able to chat with the french chef after the rush, we loved it !\n\nAnd finally, we were able to discover the chef's rissois as well as Portuguese dishes, made with fresh, high-quality products, transformed by the talented chef who offers simple, local cuisine, prepared with brilliance and a lot of heart.\n\nHuge shout-out for the salada da horta and the chili üòâ A thousand thanks for the welcome and the service, and congratulations to the team.\n\nWe went there twice in 3 days (including 1 takeaway)‚Ä¶ a good average üòâ"

A riss√≥l is a breaded Portuguese patty stuffed with meat, seafood, or vegetables, very much like an empanada. These riss√≥is are baked not fried, so they don‚Äôt feel heavy. I had a prawn riss√≥l and a chouri√ßo and queijo riss√≥l along with a bowl of divine tomato rice and a glass of Douro red wine. For dessert I had a rich berry panna cotta topped with meringues, and a glass of Nierpoort ruby port. Service was friendly and excellent, and, well, being able to sit outside on a February evening when you‚Äôre visiting from Ireland is just magical."

We had the truffle, chicken and calzone rissois (two each as recommended) plus the tomato rice and a mixed salad to share, with a glass of red. The food was so delicious  and the salad was full of interesting vegetables  (the best we have had in Portugal). We  finished with a dark chocolate mousse and a rice pudding and a glass of port which felt decadent and treaty. The waiting staff were lovely. The chef was friendly and chatty but unobtrusive. What a great dining experience! Walked out happy and feeling full but not as if we had had a heavy meal. Also very reasonably priced.  Highly recommend."

We sat at the end of the counter and watched the chef do his thing while he prepared the food. It was great fun talking with him! My wife loved the food. The service was excellent!

        "review_text": "Having visited Brunchit during our city break to Madrid, their Porto cafe was firmly on our list. We visited on a rainy morning shortly after they opened so had the pick of the seating, but by the time we left there was a queue outside - that tells you how good the food is. We enjoyed the Vegan and Salty pancakes, Sexy Omelette, and Yoghurt bowl - alongside the oat milk flat whites and a specially made hot chocolate. The cafe has a great vibe as you can see into the kitchen and hear the coffee grinder - this isn‚Äôt your typical cafe chain!"

        "review_text": "This was a great start to our day.  The space is bright and open and the staff very friendly.  I‚Äôm a bit of a chai snob, but the one I had here was SO good - one of the best I‚Äôve had! The food was presented beautifully, and was delicious.  We both got the Avocado Feast with egg - one with poached egg, one with scrambled.  I was expecting toasted bread, which I prefer, so I wasn‚Äôt a big a fan of the texture the crushed tomato created on that slice of bread. The avocado covered slice I had fewer issues with, and the overall flavours were excellent. I particularly liked the pop of flavour the pomegranate arils provided.  Both types of eggs were nicely cooked, but if you want an egg on each slice, ensure you ask for 2 poached eggs.  The scrambled eggs came as a side, and the portion appeared to be larger.  Overall, we both really enjoyed our meal, and it filled us plenty for 4 hours of walking the city.  The menu had lots of options, and it appears that vegetarians would have plenty to choose from. Would recommend."

It was relatively quiet on both days that we went (Tuesday and Thursday) there was plenty of space and it wasn‚Äôt busy like some of the other brunch spots we had found on Instagram. A lovely quiet outside spot where you can sit and enjoy some peace! The decor and vibe is beautiful. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We had the chocolate pancakes, the salty pancakes and the brioche. They were all delicious and the presentation was excellent!"

Most dishes have the same sauce and taste like it kills the taste of toast or eggs. \nI would recommend it for coffee but for breakfast or brunch or a joke. Total tourist. \nWe were a group of 6 friends and we all agreed in the opinion, there are better options in Porto!"
